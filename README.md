# Node.js Modules Demo

This simple repo provides a [Node.js modules](https://nodejs.org/en/knowledge/getting-started/what-is-require/) demo.

## Explainer

The `index.js` file is able to import and execute JavaScript from files in the `modules` directory.

The `multiply.js` file is exporting an object containing a function which we can destructure on import, while the `divide.js` file is only exporting a function.

## Run the Demo

Download the repo and run the `index.js` file using Node.js.
